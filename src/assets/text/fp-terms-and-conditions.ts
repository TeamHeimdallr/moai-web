export const termsAndConditions = `FuturePass is your portal in and out of apps, experiences and worlds throughout the Open Metaverse.

It protects all aspects of your identity and data, it stores your assets, manages permissions, helps you build status and safeguards your funds wherever you go.

Your FuturePass makes your journey simpler and safer than ever before.

FuturePass Terms and Conditions

These FuturePass Terms and Conditions (Terms) apply to all FuturePass Owners (“Owners”, “you”, “yourself”, “your”) - they govern use of your FuturePass within metaverse experiences. Please read these Terms carefully - by creating a FuturePass you agree to these Terms.

In these Terms, references to “Futureverse”, “we”, “our” and “us” means Futureverse Corporation Limited, a New Zealand company with its registered office at 17 South Street, Newton, Auckland 1010, New Zealand, or to experiences hosted in the web3 environments (as the context requires).

Early Access Version: We are currently rolling out an Early Access Version of FuturePass while we continue to build on the existing FuturePass functionalities. Certain FuturePass functions referred to in these Terms (such as Dashboards and Permissions) are not currently available - but we are working on operationalizing these (and other) FuturePass functions to improve your FuturePass user experience in the future.

1. Definitions
    1. Assets means the digital assets, collectibles, funds, keypairs, and other assets stored and managed in your FuturePass in accordance with associated Permissions.
    2. Content means any content that is created, posted, submitted, uploaded, or otherwise transmitted via a FuturePass.
    3. Custodial means a wallet where the private keys are held and controlled by a third party.
    4. Dashboard means the management dashboard for your FuturePass which is accessible when logged into your FuturePass via your Primary Wallet(s), where you can view, manage, and update FuturePass details, including changing Permissioned Wallets.
    5. Experience means any Metaverse and/or web3 experience and/or application (App) that has adopted FuturePass for identity and Asset management within their experience/App.
    6. FuturePass means an on-chain identity contract that can be used to manage Assets and engage with metaverse Experiences. A FuturePass is accessed by proving ownership of a Permissioned Wallet.
    7. Non-Custodial means a wallet where the private keys are solely held and controlled by the user.
    8. Permissioned Wallet means any Custodial or Non-Custodial wallet that you have granted Permissions to access and/or engage with your FuturePass, including and in addition to your Primary Wallet(s).
    9. Permissions means specific authoriszations and/or restrictions a Permissioned Wallet has to:
        - Use a FuturePass to interact with Experiences; and
        - Access a FuturePass’ Assets and Content.

        Available Permissions for a FuturePass will vary between Permissioned Wallets across different Experiences and Assets.

    10. Primary Wallet means the main Permissioned Wallet(s) (either Custodial or Non-custodial) underpinning and with Permissions giving you access to your FuturePass.
    11. Vault means the Futureverse vault where the private keypair(s) for Custodial Permissioned Wallets are stored in an encrypted state.
2. FuturePass eligibility
    1. In order to create a FuturePass, you must:
        - not already have a FuturePass;
        - have your own valid Permissioned Wallet; and
        - if you are creating a FuturePass on behalf of a business or other entity, you confirm that you have authority to act on its behalf and that the entity agrees to these Terms.
    2. Each FuturePass is limited to one identity (i.e., one FuturePass Holder) only - the FuturePass Holder must validly own or have the right to their Primary Wallet.
    3. There is a limit of one (1) FuturePass per person/FuturePass Holder - i.e. you can only create one (1) FuturePass.
3. Creating a FuturePass
    1. You can create a FuturePass by connecting an existing Non-Custodial Primary Wallet, or with a Custodial Primary Wallet:
        - Non-Custodial: to create a FuturePass using a Non-Custodial Primary Wallet you’ll need to:
            - sign a prompted transaction using an existing Non-Custodial wallet; and
            - agree to these Terms and read the [Risk Disclosure Statement](https://futureverse.com/policies/futurepass-risk); or
        - Custodial: to create a FuturePass using a Custodial Primary Wallet you’ll need to:
            - either login using your Google account or by entering a 6-digit code sent to your email address. In this scenario your Google credentials or email will authorize access to a private key for your Primary Wallet generated and stored by Futureverse in the Futureverse Vault; and
            - agree to these Terms and read the [Risk Disclosure Statement](https://futureverse.com/policies/futurepass-risk)
    2. You agree to provide us with any other information we may reasonably request from time to time, for example where we need to meet our own legal requirements.
4. FuturePass security
    1. You are responsible for maintaining security of your FuturePass. Do not share access to your Primary Wallet(s) with anyone else. Provided we have complied with our Custodial Primary Wallet obligations (if any), you accept all risk of any unauthorized use of or access to your FuturePass and any actions and transactions made through the same.
    2. Custodial Primary Wallet(s): where your FuturePass has a Custodial Primary Wallet(s), the private key(s) for your Primary Wallet(s) will be created, encrypted, and stored in the Futureverse Vault. You can manage and change your Primary Wallet(s) and Permissions through your Dashboard.
    3. Non-custodial Primary Wallet: where your FuturePass has a Non-Custodial Primary Wallet(s), you have sole control of and responsibility for your private key(s) and for keeping access to your FuturePass via the Primary Wallet(s) secure.
    4. FuturePass security protocols will change in accordance with any FuturePass updates you make between Custodial and Non-Custodial Primary Wallets and Permissioned Wallets.
5. Dashboard (‘Coming Soon’)
    1. Access to your Dashboard is not currently available in the launch version of your FuturePass - we are working to roll out this functionality soon.
    2. You can only access your Dashboard (and make changes to your FuturePass) when logged in through your Primary Wallet(s).
    3. Your Dashboard allows you to view, manage, update, and customize your FuturePass at any time, including:
        - Primary Wallet(s): you can view, add, and remove your Primary Wallet(s) including switching between Custodial and Non-Custodial options (provided a FuturePass must always have at least one (1) Primary Wallet at all times).
        - Permissioned Wallet(s): you can view, add, and remove your Permissioned Wallet(s) and update associated Permissions for any Permissioned Wallets.
        - Assets: you can view, manage, send, add, remove, and use the Assets linked to your FuturePass, including the Permissions relevant to any Asset.

Any updates will not affect your ability to manage your Assets, Primary Wallet, and Permissioned Wallet(s).
6. Permissions (‘Coming Soon’)
    1. Permissions are not currently available in the launch version of your FuturePass - we are working to roll out this functionality soon.
    2. You control how your FuturePass is accessed and used within available Permissions. Experiences and Permissioned Wallets can only engage with your FuturePass in the way you have authorised (or, as the case may be, restricted) them to through available Permissions.
    3. You can manage and control your FuturePass accessibility and activity by using Permissions to authorise and/or restrict Permissioned Wallets to use your FuturePass to:
        - engage with Experiences (and each Experience’s ability to engage with your FuturePass); and
